These are my codeforces notes.

   The first approach is naturally swapping, but the real breakthrough of the problem is knowing that you can just place rather than swap as you have to derange and not arrange so you can just count the elements and arrange them in one particular way such that it is impossible to get the letter in the problematic order. Just get them in TNF order.

8. B. Swap and Delete [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1913/B] #1000
   This problem again reminds me of the two other problems that I have done one is of the good array and the other is of arranging, the first approach I thought just excess 1s or 0s will be the minimum number of coins but I quickly realised that the problem with this approach is that we can only delete from the resulting array not from the original therefore we have to replace the 1s and 0s with the other from left to right first and as soon as we can't everything else has to be deleted.
