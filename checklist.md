Flush & format: endl or cout.flush(), no extra prints.  

Indices & bounds: 1-based vs 0-based, 0 <= i < n, arrays big enough.  

Edge cases: n=0/1, empty arrays/strings, all zeros/ones, last element.  

Loops & conditions: < vs <=, > vs >=, binary search termination.  

Sanity check: sum/counts make sense, globals reset, quick small test.
